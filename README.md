# Why should you use [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord)?
Well, take a look at the other popular Android Discord mods: <sub>_Last updated: Sep 17 2022_</sub>

### [Bluecord](https://bluesmods.com):
* ‚Åâ Semi-active discord server; The owner Blue is not very active there.
* ü§∑‚Äç Bluecord is run by a secretive developer (named "Blue"). You use what is added in Bluecord at your own risk.
* ‚ùå Blue claims he has plans to open-source Bluecord, it is not known whether it was said to promote his "good reputation" or not.
* Bluecord is _not modular_, meaning what he adds is all you get.
* Runs an aged version of discord
* Blue has a negative reputation from interactions of his previous mods and attitudes :trollface:
